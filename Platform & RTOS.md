**Microsoft Azure RTOS**    



https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/rtos/overview-rtos     



Azure RTOS is a real time operating system (RTOS) for Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices powered by microcontroller units (MCUs). Azure  RTOS is designed to support most highly constrained devices (battery  powered and having less than 64 KB of flash memory).     

The Azure RTOS platform is the collection of run-time solutions  including Azure RTOS ThreadX, Azure RTOS FileX, Azure RTOS GUIX, Azure  RTOS NetX, Azure RTOS NetX Duo, and Azure RTOS USBX.

**Mbed OS**: An open source OS from ARM         



https://os.mbed.com/mbed-os/     



An open source, easy-to-use operating system for the Internet of Things (IoT).   Mbed OS includes all the features you need to develop a connected product quickly based on an Arm Cortex-M microcontroller, including security, storage, connectivity, an RTOS, device management and drivers for sensors and I/O devices.

**Zephyr**:  An open source RTOS for IOT     



https://docs.zephyrproject.org       



The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications.

```
The Zephyr kernel supports multiple architectures, including:
        ARCv2 (EM and HS) and ARCv3 (HS6X)
        ARMv6-M, ARMv7-M, and ARMv8-M (Cortex-M)
        ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A (Cortex-A, 32- and 64-bit)
        ARMv7-R, ARMv8-R (Cortex-R, 32- and 64-bit)
        Intel x86 (32- and 64-bit)
        MIPS (MIPS32 Release 1 specification)
        NIOS II Gen 2
        RISC-V (32- and 64-bit)
        SPARC V8
        Tensilica Xtensa
```

**FreeRTOS**    



https://www.freertos.org/    



FreeRTOS is a market-leading real-time operating system RTOS for microcontrollers and small microprocessors. Distributed freely  under the MIT open source license, FreeRTOS includes a kernel and a  growing set of IoT libraries suitable for use across all industry  sectors. FreeRTOS is built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of  use.

**RT-Thread**:  An open source RTOS from China     



https://www.rt-thread.org/    



RT-Thread is mainly written in C language, easy to understand and easy  to port(can be quickly port to a wide range of mainstream MCUs and  module chips). It applies object-oriented programming methods to  real-time system design, making the code elegant, structured, modular,  and very tailorable.    

RT-Thread has Standard version and Nano version. For  resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU) systems, the NANO kernel  version that requires only 3KB Flash and 1.2KB RAM memory resources can  be tailored  with easy-to-use tools; And for resource-rich IoT devices,  RT-Thread can use the on-line software package management tool, together with system configuration tools, to achieve intuitive and rapid modular cutting, seamlessly import rich software packages, thus achieving  complex functions like Android's graphical interface and touch sliding  effects, smart voice interaction effects, and so on.
