**openBLT**: A popular bootloader on microcontrollers   

https://github.com/feaser/openblt   

OpenBLT can be ported to any 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit microcontroller  and currently runs on runs on ST STM32, Infineon XMC, NXP S12, and TI  TM4C and LM3S microcontrollers. It is most popular on STM32  microcontrollers.   

By default, it supports communication interfaces such as: RS232, CAN, USB, TCP/IP and it ships with the easy-to-use MicroBoot PC tool for initiating and monitoring the firmware update. Performing  firmware updates directly from an SD-card is also supported.
